# Templates

This folder holds Furniture Packs made to be used as examples for specific features. If you think there's something in FF that would be easier to understand with a template, feel free to suggest it.

## Seasonal Furniture

This is a very simple example of a Mixed Pack (CP + FF) to create a Furniture with a sprite that depends on the in-game season. This method works with a lot of CP tokens like `season` and `weather`. This was originally in the Example Pack but was moved here for practical purposes.

## Dropdown Config

This is an example of how to create a Mixed Pack (CP + FF) which create a config option to switch between variants of a Furniture with a dropdown option button in the Generic Mod Config Menu (GMCM).

## Time Based Animation

This is an example of how to make a Furniture with different animations depending on the time of day.  
It works by having a Furniture both with an `Animation` field and `Time Based` set to `true`. To make it animated only during the day/night, simply make all the frames for the night/day identical.

## Full CP Pack

This is an example of how to make a Furniture Pack by putting it entirely in FF's Default Pack with Content Patcher
