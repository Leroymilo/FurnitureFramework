# How do I implement the data model for 3.1?

Because of how dynamic the json format of a Furniture is, the data model is really tricky to make. The data model is the code structure that makes it possible for CP to patch a FF content file like any file from the "Content/Data" folder of Stardew Valley.
There are 2 ways I can think of doing this so that the FF content format can keep all of its freedom of structure, I'll list the pros and cons of both of them here.

## Rotations required first

In this case, the model parses the Rotations field first, then it will parse all Directional Fields (and Lists) by parsing them once on each direction.

Pros:
- Can skip fields with an invalid direction key
- No need to specify a direction key when patching directional sub-fields with CP (`TargetField` would be `[ "Furniture", "<FurniureID>", "Layers", "<DirectionKey>", "LayerID", "SourceRect" ]` to access the data in the `Source Rect` of a `Layer`)

Cons:
- Requires `Rotations` to appear before all rotational fields in the Furniture definition (bad practice) (slightly breaks backwards compatibility)

## Explicit direction keys everywhere

In this case, the model parses Directional Fields (and Lists) by filling a dictionary with any direction key it sees, and direction keys are then used to fetch data from this dictionary.

Pros:
- No parsing error if `Rotations` is placed after a directional field

Cons:
- It is required to specify a direction key to patch any directional sub-field with CP (`TargetField` would be `[ "Furniture", "<FurniureID>", "Layers", "<DirectionKey1>", "LayerID", "SourceRect", "<DirectionKey2>" ]` to access the data in the `Source Rect` of a `Layer`, which is annoying if there are a lot of them to patch).

## Magic third case taking the best of both worlds

Pros:
- No need to specify a direction key when patching directional sub-fields with CP (`TargetField` would be `[ "Furniture", "<FurniureID>", "Layers", "<DirectionKey>", "LayerID", "SourceRect" ]` to access the data in the `Source Rect` of a `Layer`)
- No parsing error if `Rotations` is placed after a directional field

Cons:
- Don't know how to do that :(
