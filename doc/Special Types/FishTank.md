# How to define a Custom Fish-Tank

To customize your Fish-Tank, your can use these fields:

## Fish Area (directional)

This is a [Rectangle](https://github.com/Leroymilo/FurnitureFramework/blob/main/doc/Structures/Rectangle.md) **in pixels** that defines which part of the sprite the fishes will be able to swim in.

## Disable Fishtank Light

This is simply a boolean (true or false) to disable the light that the fishtank emits at night.

## Other

Don't forget to use a [Layer](https://github.com/Leroymilo/FurnitureFramework/blob/main/doc/Furniture.md#layers) so that there's a layer of glass in front of the fishes.
